# Learnings â€” POC Simplification

## What surprised us
- The initial design was quite comprehensive but overly complex for a proof of concept
- Many "best practices" (thread safety, queuing, etc.) can wait until after proving the core functionality
- Clear separation of POC vs future features helps focus implementation effort

## Decisions made (and why)

### Keep for POC
1. **Modular architecture** - Separate ScrollDispatcher and QuartzScrollAction for clarity
2. **Configuration via YAML** - Better than hardcoding, minimal overhead
3. **HUD overlay** - Visual feedback is important even in POC
4. **Natural scrolling detection** - Core to user experience

### Defer to Future
1. **Thread safety** - Single-threaded is fine for POC
2. **Event queuing** - Direct function calls are simpler
3. **Complex error handling** - Console logging suffices
4. **Architecture tests** - Focus on functionality first
5. **Event validation** - Trust the gesture detector

## Implementation Simplifications

### ScrollDispatcher (POC version)
```python
class ScrollDispatcher:
    def __init__(self, config: ScrollConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.action = QuartzScrollAction(config)
    
    def dispatch(self, event: CircularEvent) -> bool:
        try:
            self.action.execute(event)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Scroll error: {e}")
            return False
```

### QuartzScrollAction (POC version)
```python
class QuartzScrollAction:
    def execute(self, event: CircularEvent):
        # Simple calculation
        pixels = event.total_angle_deg * self.config.pixels_per_degree
        delta_y = -pixels if event.direction == CircularDirection.CLOCKWISE else pixels
        
        # Respect natural scrolling
        if self._natural_scrolling:
            delta_y = -delta_y
        
        # Create and post event
        event = CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent(None, kCGScrollEventUnitPixel, 1, int(delta_y))
        CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, event)
```

## Follow-ups
- Implement POC in ~2-3 days instead of 5
- Test core functionality thoroughly
- Add complexity only where user testing shows need
- Keep future improvements documented for reference
