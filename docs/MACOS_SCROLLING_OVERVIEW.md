# macOS Scrolling Feature - Complete Documentation Overview

## Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the macOS scrolling feature for Glide, linking all relevant documentation and design files.

## Feature Description
Glide's macOS scrolling feature enables hands-free document scrolling using circular hand gestures:
- **Clockwise circles** → Scroll down
- **Counter-clockwise circles** → Scroll up
- **180° rotation** ≈ 400 pixels of scroll

Perfect for reading while eating - keep your greasy fingers off the keyboard!

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Proposal & Planning
- **[Proposal Document](proposals/macos-scrolling.md)**
  - Problem statement: Bridge gesture detection to system control
  - Success metrics: <150ms latency, smooth scrolling
  - Decision: PyObjC with Quartz Events for v1

- **[Task Breakdown](planning/macos-scrolling/TASKS.md)**
  - 5 tasks, each ≤1 day
  - Clear acceptance criteria
  - Test plans for each component

### 2. Technical Design
- **[Main Design Document](designs/macos-scrolling/DESIGN.md)**
  - Architecture overview
  - Public interfaces
  - Data flow: CircularDetector → ScrollDispatcher → QuartzScrollAction
  - Test strategy

### 3. Subsystem Specifications
- **[ScrollDispatcher](designs/macos-scrolling/subsystems/scroll-dispatcher.md)**
  - Converts CircularEvent → ScrollIntent
  - Thread-safe event routing
  - Configuration management

- **[QuartzScrollAction](designs/macos-scrolling/subsystems/quartz-scroll-action.md)**
  - macOS event generation via CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent
  - Natural scrolling support
  - Main thread execution

- **[ScrollHUD](designs/macos-scrolling/subsystems/scroll-hud.md)**
  - Minimal visual feedback
  - Circular arrow indicators
  - Fade animations

### 4. Supporting Documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Days 1-2)
1. **PyObjC Integration**
   - Add dependency
   - Test Quartz APIs
   - Natural scrolling detection

2. **ScrollDispatcher**
   - Gesture → intent mapping
   - Angle-to-pixel conversion
   - Thread safety

### Phase 2: macOS Integration (Days 3-4)
3. **QuartzScrollAction**
   - Smooth scroll events
   - Begin/Changed/End sequences
   - Error handling

4. **HUD Overlay**
   - Visual feedback
   - Non-blocking window
   - Dark mode support

### Phase 3: Polish (Day 5)
5. **Integration & Testing**
   - End-to-end pipeline
   - Cross-app testing
   - Performance optimization

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| PyObjC for v1 | Simpler than Swift helper, single Python process |
| 180° = 400px | Intuitive mapping, roughly half screen |
| Clockwise = down | Matches physical wheel metaphor |
| Monolithic app | Easier development, defer split architecture to v2 |

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] Smooth scrolling in Preview, Safari, Chrome
- [ ] Natural scrolling preference respected
- [ ] Circular gestures feel intuitive

### Performance
- [ ] Latency < 150ms from gesture to scroll
- [ ] 30+ FPS maintained during scrolling
- [ ] CPU usage < 5% additional

### Quality
- [ ] < 1 false positive per 5-minute session
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, architecture)
- [ ] Clear error messages for permission issues

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Accessibility permission denied | Clear instructions, graceful degradation |
| Thread safety issues | All Quartz calls on main thread |
| Performance problems | Profile early, optimize if needed |
| App compatibility | Test top 10 macOS apps |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Confirm all documentation meets requirements
2. **Create missing docs**: CHANGELOG.md, README.md updates
3. **Begin implementation**: Start with Task 1 (PyObjC integration)
4. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first per CLAUDE.md

---

## Questions for Review

1. Is the 180° = 400px mapping appropriate?
2. Should we support horizontal scrolling in v1?
3. Any specific apps to prioritize for testing?
4. Preferred HUD position and style?
